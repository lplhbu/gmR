I had my eye on this game for a long time, but I constantly put it off, not daring to sit down and properly delve into the combat system. Now I regret that I didn't do it sooner. The game really turned out to be worthwhile and without a doubt one of the best tactics of its time. In terms of hacking, this game turned out to be one of the most difficult that I had to deal with. The legacy of the SNES with all the limitations of this system affected.

The easy project which was supposed to have been started and finished in a matter of but a few weeks turned into so much more. The major reason behind this was that PS1 official translation turned out to be as far from the canon as Earth and Pluto. Therefore, we took the PSP official version text and inserted it into the Saturn version (as the most perfect Tactics Ogre translation currently available). Yet, the Saturn version (just like PS1) is slightly different from the PSP one, so most spells, items and some such have different translations as well as special events only available in Saturn and PS1 versions. At the same time, we tried keeping to the March of the Black Queen translation previously released by us in line with the Let Us Cling Together for the same continuity of events, characters and story. Hope it worked out in the end. Enjoy the game as we all did!

Like Ogre Battle, I also owned Tactics Ogre on the PS1 way back when. I don't remember getting too far into it, so it was nice being able to finally play through the game. On another note, I really wish these companies would make new games instead of rehashing the same game over and over again.

About 4MB Extended RAM Cartridge
=====================================================
4MB Extended Ram Cartridge auto-detection can be disabled by holding the "L+R" key combination while the Sega Saturn logo is animated. But keep in mind that in this case, you will not be able to speed up data loading.

Patching Instructions
=====================================================
1. Copy all the patch files into a folder containing the original multi-track game image in the "Bin/Cue" format!
2. Launch the "START.BAT" file.
3. To make things safer, the original data track is saved in the same folder (with the "old" extension). You may further delete after successful patching.
4. All the patch files are automatically deleted at the end of the patching process!

The original image should be equivalent to the one found here:
